Scotland JS 2014: 
===============

Repo for Scotland JS 2014 keynote. Script and planning can go here in the README, slide deck bootstrapping to come shortly. If you're contributing, write in Markdown for now, can auto-magically convert to HTML once slide deck is up.

Rough Outline Sorta Thing
=============

The goal of this talk is to explore the biases and behaviors of 'pure' programmers toward 'designer-developer' hybrids. The biases include:

- designers and/or designer-developers can't program as well as pure devs
- design is just fluff and pictures
- if one doesn't see a lot of code commit on a designers' github, it must be because they don't code a lot - as opposed to coding on private, proprietary repos which a lot of people do for jobs - addresses the fallacy of assuming that if someone doesn't have a lot of open source, they are somehow inferior as a programmer.. a weird one
- add bias here! there are many. I can't think of them all right now

The talk should be delivered in a deadpan, super serious fashion, with the content being an obvious juxtaposition with ridiculousness. 

By the end, the talk should address the content with something like 'if you think I sound ridiculous, well, this isn't far off from how ridiculous and arrogant you sound like when you say these things'. Something like that.

Rough Script
============

"Hello, my name is Angelina Fabbro. I work on the developer wrench team at Mozzarella. You're probably familiar with our browser, Mozzarella Foxfire, as well as Foxfire OS, the first mobile phone to target exclusively the red panda population. Despite dwindling numbers and endangered status with the World Wildlife Federation, red pandas use social media 210% more than all other animals, including humans. It was natural for us to tap that market."

"Last year at JSConf US, I gave a talk on how to be a better programmer. I didn't expect it to be as popular as it has been. Around the same time, I published an article on The Pastry Box about something called 'Impostor Syndrome', often referred to as 'Impostor Phenomenon'. I called for anyone who writes code to stop discounting their practice as invalid for any reason. If you write code, you're a developer."

"... or so I thought. Well, I'm here to apologize and tell you that I was wrong. There are impostors in our industry, and I'm positive some of them are here around you in this very room.""
