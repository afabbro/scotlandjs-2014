Scotland JS 2014: 
===============

Repo for Scotland JS 2014 keynote. Script and planning can go here in the README, slide deck bootstrapping to come shortly. If you're contributing, write in Markdown for now, can auto-magically convert to HTML once slide deck is up.

Rough Outline Sorta Thing
=============

The goal of this talk is to explore the biases and behaviors of 'pure' programmers toward 'designer-developer' hybrids. The biases include:

- designers and/or designer-developers can't program as well as pure devs
- design is just fluff and pictures
- if one doesn't see a lot of code commit on a designers' github, it must be because they don't code a lot - as opposed to coding on private, proprietary repos which a lot of people do for jobs - addresses the fallacy of assuming that if someone doesn't have a lot of open source, they are somehow inferior as a programmer.. a weird one
- add bias here! there are many. I can't think of them all right now

The talk should be delivered in a deadpan, super serious fashion, with the content being an obvious juxtaposition with ridiculousness. 

By the end, the talk should address the content with something like 'if you think I sound ridiculous, well, this isn't far off from how ridiculous and arrogant you sound like when you say these things'. Something like that.

Rough Script
============

Hello, my name is Angelina Fabbro. I work on the developer wrench team at Mozzarella. You're probably familiar with our browser, Mozzarella Foxfire, as well as Foxfire OS, the first mobile phone to target exclusively the red panda population. Despite dwindling numbers and endangered status with the World Wildlife Federation, red pandas use social media 210% more than all other animals, including humans. It was natural for us to tap that market.

Last year at JSConf US, I gave a talk on how to be a better programmer. I didn't expect it to be as popular as it has been. Around the same time, I published an article on The Pastry Box about something called 'Impostor Syndrome', often referred to as 'Impostor Phenomenon'. I called for anyone who writes code to stop discounting their practice as invalid for any reason. If you write code, you're a developer.

... or so I thought. Well, I'm here to apologize and tell you that I was wrong. There are impostors in our industry, and I'm positive some of them are here around you in this very room.

In this presentation, I plan to outline the 10 reasons that you might not be a Real Developer.
>>>>>>> origin/poopbot

1. You Know CSS
---------------
Obviously, if you know CSS, you're a designer, not a developer. True developers work exclusively in the land of abstract bits. If you can't handle a little bit of abstraction or a little bit of delegation, you can't possibly be a REAL developer.

2. You Don't Know CSS
---------------------
I'm going to be frank with you. If you're using a framework or a toolkit that provides style for you, but you don't understand the underlying CSS, you can't possibly be a real developer. 

In order to build programs, you need to see through every abstraction and be able to work comfortably
at the lowest possible layer. This means, if you're building Javascript applications, you simply *must*
be completely comfortable building them with nothing but ECMAScript, HTML, and CSS. 

3. You Don't Know How To Write Programs in Assembly Code
--------------------------------------------------------
Is that enough, though, really? I mean, a REAL developer knows how their programs compile down to assembly code. If you're the sort of hack developer who just builds programs in ECMAScript, HTML, and CSS without knowing how Firefox compiles it's C++ code into a Javascript interpreter, then woe betide you trying to be taken seriously in a development context. How will you write efficient programs if you don't understand the memory model of the system you're working with? 

4. You Don't Know Exactly The Things That I Know
------------------------------------------------
In fact, I've decided to draw a line in the sand. A Venn Diagram. If I know a thing, it's a thing that you need to know in order to be a Real Developer. Put your hand up if you know what a B-Tree is. Okay, all of you are real developers. Okay, who knows how a Bloom Filter works. Hands up.  Everybody who just put your hands down? You're not Real Developers anymore. 

Now, on the other hand, if I *don't* know a thing, it's little more than a needless abstraction that you don't need to know about to be an effective developer. Hey, do you know about how Java handles thread pooling? Of course not, I'm a node.js developer. All of MY eventing is handled with an event loop, like GOD INTENDED. 

5. You're Not a 24-Year Old White Guy
-------------------------------------
Seriously? Why would you even want to be a software developer if you're not a 24-year-old white guy? 

The whole reason we named our company "Mozzarella" is because we wanted it to be nothing but a uniform pasty white expanse of dudes named Chad or Trent.

6. Most of Your Work is with Servers, People, or Art Assets
-----------------------------------------------------------
If you work with a server in any capacity, you're ops, and shouldn't be taken seriously as a developer. 

If you work with people, you're either a manager or a community interaction specialist, and either way you obviously you shouldn't be taken seriously as a developer. 

And if you work with art assets, well, you should just leave right now. You monster.

7. Your GitHub Account is Empty or Nonexistant
----------------------------------------------
Do you know what separates REAL Developers from fake ones? Real developers have dozens and dozens of projects in their GitHub account at any given time.

Now, in order to accomplish this, you're going to have to give up a lot of your free time. If you're out hiking or having beers with your friends, you should be asking yourself: could I be coding right now? Am I a REAL developer? Also, you might have to slack off at work a little bit - there's nothing that kills your coding buzz like having to do work on copyrighted code on a private repository during normal work hours.

Here's a game you could be playing. Count all of your active github repositories, then include the number of open-source repositories you've forked. Finally, multiply this by the number of "favourites" that you have. This number is a measure of your value as a person. 

8. You're Concerned about User-Experience
-----------------------------------------
WORDS WORDS WORDS THEY GO HERE HERP DERP

9. You're Wrong, Ever
---------------------
There is nothing, nothing in the world, more poisonous to your reputation as a real developer than admitting that you don't know something - or, worse, admitting that you might at some point have been wrong about something.

My recommendation is simple: if you think you're right about something, really dig in your heels. Argue about it until you're red in the face, no matter how inconsequential. It doesn't matter what you accomplish - what really matters is that everybody around you acknowledges that you are right.

10. You're Actually an Impostor
-------------------------------
Okay, so, let's imagine you've done everything that you can to become a real developer, and you still don't feel like one. 

That's because you're not. All of your coworkers are, but you're just a moron. Everybody talks about you behind your back all of the time. They know that you're not a real developer.

You have no idea what you're doing. And the worst possible thing would be for someone around you to discover that you've been an impostor this whole time.

You, sir, in the audience. With the T-Shirt that says "Linux Forever" on it. Stand up. 

What's your name.  

    "Brent".

Would you say that you're a real developer?  

    *nervously* "Yes... I would."

Take off that T-shirt.  

    "I don't want to."

Take it off!    

    *sigh*  *takes off the t-shirt to reveal a full suit*

You're a business major!    

    *hiss* *runs away*

Everybody be careful. They're everywhere. 


Conclusion
----------
Remember, everybody. The whole reason we're here is to keep other people out. Software development is serious and exclusive, and if we start letting suits and designers and anybody else pretend to be developers, it's just going to get worse for all of us - so stay on the watch, and remember - if you see someone who's not a REAL developer, report it to the nearest authority. They'll know what to do.
