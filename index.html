        Last year at JSConf US, I gave a talk on how to be a better programmer. 

        I didn't expect it to be that popular, but I guess it resonated with a lot of people. 

        In fact, it's because of that talk that Peter invited me here to speak at Scotland JS. 

        Peter asked me to do something like it; something 'aspirational' in nature. The kind of talk that gets at the truth of something.

        Around the same time, I was writing some thoughts out for a website called The Pastry Box, and I wrote an article on 'impostor phenomenon' more commonly known as 'impostor syndrome'.

        I called for anyone who writes code to stop discounting their practice as invalid for any reason. 

        If you write code, you're a developer. This was the message I wanted everyone to have in their heart.

        Obviously, if you encounter someone who knows CSS, also known as California Style Sheets, they're a designer, not a developer. 

        CSS is mainly used to make things look good on the web, which as we've already established is unnecessary and the hallmark of someone who is not a real developer, because CSS is not a real programming language. 

        In fact, industry expert Dr. Jenn Schiffer published a whole article on how to deprecate your CSS so that we have one less language in our stack to worry about.

        I'm going to be frank with you. If you're using a framework or a toolkit that provides style for you, but you don't understand the underlying CSS, you can't possibly be a real developer. 

        That's right - you shouldn't know CSS too well, otherwise then you are in the dangerous position of accidentally learning how to design. 

        Still, CSS is everywhere, and you need to know how to deal with it and deprecate it as Dr. Jenn Schiffer has recommended.

      <footer class="notes">
        There are other impostors in the world of design too. They go by the names of 'user experience designer', 'interaction designer', or something else fluffy like that.

        Basically these people are like designers but worse.

        These jerks pretend to know how software should behave so that users aren't frustrated.

        Mostly they just end up being annoying as they talk about things like 
        use cases, 
        user testing, and design patterns. 

        You know as soon as the words 'design patterns' come up that you're dealing with another fraud..

        Remember: By telling you how the software should behave, they're telling you how you should write your code.

        It's safe to ignore their arrogant suggestions, because nobody knows how to code better than you do.

        If your boss tells you to listen to them, only implement parts of what they explain to you.

        Make it abundantly clear that you control the domain of programming at the company, and that you're only going to take their 'advice' when you feel like it.

        Your users aren't going to notice a difference. We've already established you don't need great design to acquire users and clicks.

        jQuery is a programming language that is even more popular than JavaScript because it was made so that designers could pretend to know how to code.

        Just think! Fumbling about they might click on some ads, and make us some money.

        Even if we don't have ads, well, we could just use an HTML input field and let a Real Developer handle the input.

        Of course, if you don't know jQuery, you're also not a real developer.

        Much like Caifornia Style Sheets, jQuery should be ripped out and deprecated.

        True developers work exclusively in the land of the purest of the pure.

        In order to build programs, you need to see through every abstraction and be able to work comfortably at the lowest possible layer. 

        This means, if you're building Javascript applications, you simply must be completely comfortable building them with nothing but ECMAScript. 

        That's right, you should be programming not with JavaScript, but with the scripting language standard it's based on.

        The Real Developers all work server side, probably in PHP, and sometimes Nodes JavaScript. 

        If you're worried that Nodule.js might go out of fashion, consider learning a language that has already made a name for itself and stuck around through it's legacy and technical debt.

        Sure, we can say that a Real Developer wrote The Linuxes once upon a time, but since then operating systems have basically been solved forever.

        Setting up a server and backing stuff up sometimes is not a real job, and it definitely does not make you a Real Developer.

      Do you another thing that separates REAL Developers from fake ones? 

      Real developers have dozens and dozens of projects in their GitHub account at any given time.

      In order to accomplish this, you're going to have to give up a lot of your free time. If you're out hiking or having beers with your friends, you should be asking yourself: could I be coding right now? Am I a REAL developer? [turn this into bullet list?]

      Why don't I care more what everybody on the internet thinks about me?

      Also, you might have to slack off at work a little bit - there's nothing that kills your coding buzz like having to do work on copyrighted code on a private repository during normal work hours. Real Developers never work on proprietary code and are 110% OPEN SOURCE HEROES ALWAYS AND FOREVER.

      You might have other obligations like a family and kids, but nobody cares about that in the industry because you're supposed to be a 24 year old white guy after all, willing to work long hours for the good of the company, and if you can't do that, you might as well give up now.

        There is nothing, nothing in the world, more poisonous to your reputation as a real developer than admitting that you don't know something - or, worse, admitting that you might at some point have been wrong about something.

        You cannot be a code 'rock star', 'ninja', or expert of any kind if you are ever to admit being wrong. You have to be so perfect that you attain a kind of programmer god-hood amongst your peers.

        [slide with Emily Rose's quotes about opinions from JSCOnf 2013]

        Often, you can measure this by the number of Twitter followers you have, so as you begin to have serious arguments with other developers on Twitter you will have a number of people willing to back you up at all costs, thus reinforcing that you are never wrong. Because if a lot of people on The Internet say you're right, then you can sleep well at night knowing that you are right in the most absolute of terms.

        [culd use somebody's wrong on the internet XKCD here]

        My recommendation is simple: if you think you're right about something, really dig in your heels. Argue about the issue at hand until you're red in the face, no matter how inconsequential the issue might seem. Your pride is on the line! Your honor too! It doesn't matter what you accomplish - what really matters is that everybody around you acknowledges that you are right.
